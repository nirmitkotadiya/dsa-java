# 🚀 Apna College DSA Java Course

Welcome to my **Apna College DSA Series (Java)** repository! 🎉  
This is my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with **Shradha Khapra Ma’am** in **Java**.  
Here, you’ll find **structured notes**, **Java code**, and **problem-solving practices** to strengthen my DSA foundation and prepare for **competitive programming & interviews**. 💻✨
