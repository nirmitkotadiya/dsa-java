// Recursion 
=> iteration + functions 

// what is Recursion?
using Math 
f(n) = n * f(n-1)
            n-1 * f(n-2)
             .
             .
             .
             1 * f(0)


=> Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
